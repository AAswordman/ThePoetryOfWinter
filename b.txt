dialog.wb.npc.plot.20=§6 The first stage is a free-range boss fight, where you can follow the recommended procedure in the guide, or you can jump and fight the boss yourself. (ps.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.21=§6 The second phase, which is opened with the departure key. You must defeat the Awakened Ender Dragon to enter. The bosses here require a lot of skill and equipment. Also, you need to specify the BOSS order.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.26=You should be a player in this world.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.27=Listen up, there's a world on my side facing a disaster.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.28=You don't need to travel to that world to help them. You just need to be a key figure in that world, under the map.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.29=All the difficulties on your way will be reflected back to you in this world; And what you do, it reflects back into that world. And you have unlimited time to do what you need to do.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.30=Whatever happens on the road, I will tell you.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.31=Make the altar the way I did and you can communicate with that world.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.32=As for who I am, keep it a secret for now.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.34=It all starts with the Divine Oath.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.35=During one of his work trips to the research institute, he went to retrieve data from the lab and was accidentally sucked into an unknown portal. Thus, he came to the edge of the world.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.36=He will be the key to that world. From now on, you, the vow, help him through this.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.38=You are now in the Enchanted Forest. So far, so good.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.39=You teleport to a vast expanse of grass, look out into the distance and cast shadows of other worlds. You can only get closer to the nearest place where life seems to exist.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.40=The border guard at the border guard, who doesn't want you to enter, sees the sign on your clothes and not only lets you in, but kindly asks a friend in a city to receive you.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.41=You go further into the forest. On the way, a spider greets you and tells you that the army sacked the place 2,000 years ago.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.42=It takes you out of the forest. The desert is ahead.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.43=[Click close]
dialog.wb.npc.plot.44=The oath thought of the history of 2000 years ago...
dialog.wb.npc.plot.45=Two thousand years ago...
dialog.wb.npc.plot.46=It was a time of war, and there was a real polarity between man and monster.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.47=On the human side, the Braun, called the 'King of All Spirits', charged every battle, repeatedly defeated, the monster retreated and finally disappeared into the world.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.48=Fanling ascended the throne with the support of the masses, ushering in a great era of unity and peace. Two thousand years have passed.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.49=In the desert, you meet Beard Witz. He and his friends gave you a warm welcome.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.50=He told you something about the Guardians.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.51=[Click close]
dialog.wb.npc.plot.52=What is a Guardian?
dialog.wb.npc.plot.53=All who are native here belong to the Guardians, except for the monsters that arrived two thousand years ago. They are born in a region, and once they leave it, they leave an uncontrolled body in their place.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.54=The body is not self-aware, but mechanically attacks intruders. They don't die, and once they're back to zero, they go dormant until they're full again.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.55=In front of you, there is such a guardian:
dialog.wb.npc.plot.56=Magic Fossil block.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.57=[closed]
dialog.wb.npc.plot.58=Please ensure that no other bosses exist within a 200 radius.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.59=[Summon BOSS] (just click once!)
dialog.wb.npc.plot.60=Fossil block, maybe his body won't come back. He's going to explore this frontier.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.61=[Click close]
dialog.wb.npc.plot.62=Ahead, is the city.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.63=The guy that the border guard had made contact with was already waiting for you nearby. His name is [name A].
dialog.wb.npc.plot.64=well... The archive point...
dialog.wb.npc.plot.65=During the next day, you made a circuit around the city. The city is not very big, but it is too tired to lift your legs.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.66=And then he tells you about the history of the city:
dialog.wb.npc.plot.67=This is a city built on ruins. At that time, the first frontier rulers called for the construction of large cities in several remote places and a set of portals to the center of the frontier.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.68=He goes on to tell you that if you want to go back to the human world, you can go back quickly through this portal. But...
dialog.wb.npc.plot.69=He said that the border is not the same as it was a thousand years ago. This border center, political instability. If you want to stay here, you're more than welcome.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.70=That portal, which has also long since fallen into disrepair, can still be used with persistence magic.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.71=Of course, there are rumors, whether true or not, that the current border rulers have become evil enforcer...
dialog.wb.npc.plot.72=In short, better be careful. You can buy your gear here and stay for a while before you go.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.73=[Click close]
dialog.wb.npc.plot.74=You're off.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.75=Portal in cave... You try to get there, only to find that the portal has long since been removed.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.76=Although the local environment is not very good, there are still monsters living there.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.77=After you ask them for the new location of the portal, you are off.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.78=Not very smooth on the way... You see a white light -- it's Tasso Dieter's eye.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.79=Next, Tasso Dieter jumps out and rushes you with intent to attack. You get out of the way, it doesn't stop, it goes somewhere else.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.80=Here, is the cave: its guardian, is the headless guard.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.82=Please ensure that no other bosses exist within a 200 radius.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.84=Headless Guard, the first line of defense on this road. His guardian will only disappear when he returns.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.85=Where is he? I guess you went to the city.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.86=If you can pass through the portal and find or defeat the border ruler, you can return to the human world -- then maybe everything is over.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.87=As long as the Brahma is flexible, the human world will be stable.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.88=Ahead, is a road deeper underground; Inside, the ancient ruins.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.91=It doesn't feel good.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.92=They noticed it and began to watch it closely.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.93=Again, try not to go out in person to avoid disrupting the plan -- hopefully the origin side goes ahead.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.97=Along the way, you meet the Soul Guide; He showed you the way through the maze.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.98=You look at the wall and try to explain the above with your own historical knowledge and experience:
dialog.wb.npc.plot.99=Perhaps this is where the Van Spirit's army was once stationed.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.100=After the Fanling had completely ended the internal strife and unified the world, they tried to hunt down monsters and kill them all.dialog.wb.npc.plot.101=It was then that the human race had a traitor. His name is Ling Jing.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.102=He took advantage of his position to design the portal to the world border; After sending the monster away, they closed and destroyed the portal; But a part of the human army did.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.103=Then the ling mirror disappears. Disappeared along with his portal design.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.104=The murals and writing on the walls tell you that some humans simply settled nearby -- unable to return anyway; Some died in front of them.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.105=and Pionest, then in command at the border, lets all the people (who sneakily come to the centre) back in the human world; And a city was built near this cave.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.106=That's the end of the matter. From then on, there was a complete separation between the great state established by Bravo and the border monster world.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.107=Approaching the bottom of the relic. Everything around him glowed green from deep, piercing the thick dust.

dialog.wb.npc.plot.118=You run up the steps and through the hall to the center with excitement and trepidation -- and no one is stopping you.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.119=Just a second after you step into the center, the door closes.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.120=The person coming is the border governor -Masen.
dialog.wb.npc.plot.121=This is Masen's conversation:
dialog.wb.npc.plot.122=Here you are at last: I've been waiting for you.
